                         <h3>Governing Law & Dispute Resolution</h3>
                         <p>You agree that all matters relating to your access to or use of the Site, including all disputes, will be governed by the laws of France without regard to its conflicts of laws provisions.

The preceding provision regarding venue does not apply if you are a consumer based in the European Union. If you are a consumer based in the European Union, you may make a claim in the courts of the country where you reside. Any claim under these Terms of Use must be brought within one (1) year after the cause of action arises, or such claim or cause of action is barred. Claims made under the separate terms and conditions of purchase for goods and services are not subject to this limitation. No recovery may be sought or received for damages other than out-of-pocket expenses, except that the prevailing party will be entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. In the event of any controversy or dispute between Green’it and you arising out of or in connection with your use of the Site, the parties shall attempt, promptly and in good faith, to resolve any such dispute. If we are unable to resolve any such dispute within a reasonable time (not to exceed thirty (30) days), then either party may submit such controversy or dispute to mediation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through mediation, then the parties shall be free to pursue any right or remedy available to them under applicable law.</p>

These Terms of Use shall not be interpreted or construed to confer any rights or remedies on any third parties.</br></br>Green’it provides access to Green’it international data and, therefore, may contain references or cross references to Green’it products, programs and services that are not announced in your country.
