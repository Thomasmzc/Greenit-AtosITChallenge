                            <p>Updated April 08, 2021</p>
                            <h2>Green’it’s Privacy Policy describes how green’it collects, uses, and shares your personal data.</h2>
                            <h2>Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with our privacy practices, accessible via the headings below, and contact us if you have any questions.</h2>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class='contentlegal'>
                        <h3>What Is Personal Data at green’it?</h3>
                        <p>At green’it, we believe strongly in fundamental privacy rights — and that those fundamental rights should not differ depending on where you live in the world. That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by green’it as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as your interests — is personal data.</p>
                         <h3>Your Privacy Rights at green’it</h3>
                         <p>At green’it, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from green’it. Green’it does not sell your data.</br></br>To exercise your privacy rights and choices, please contact us by email at thomas@greenit.co.</br></br>There may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and green’it is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.</p>
                         <h3>Personal Data green’it Collects from You</h3>
                         <p>At green’it, we believe that you can have great services and great privacy. This means that we strive to collect only the personal data that we need. When you create a green’it ID, purchase and/or activate a service, connect to our services, contact us (including by social media), participate in an online survey, or otherwise interact with green’it, we may collect a variety of information, including:</p>

                            <li><em>Payment Information.</em>Data about your billing address and method of payment, such as bank details, credit, debit, or other payment card information</li>

                         <p>Green’it may receive personal data about you from other individuals, from businesses or third parties acting at your direction, from our partners who work with us to provide our services and assist us in security and fraud prevention, and from other lawful sources.</p>

                         <p>For research and development purposes, we may use datasets such as those that contain images, voices, or other data that could be associated with an identifiable person. When acquiring such datasets, we do so in accordance with applicable law, including law in the jurisdiction in which the dataset is hosted. When using such datasets for research and development, we do not attempt to reidentify individuals who may appear therein.</p>
